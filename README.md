### 1.**Predictive Analysis of ENEM 2022 Performance**

#### **Introduction**
The Exame Nacional do Ensino MÃ©dio (ENEM) holds a pivotal role in shaping Brazil's education landscape, serving as a determinant for student admissions into numerous higher education institutions in Brazil and even abroad. Leveraging the rich dataset that ENEM offers allows for a deep dive into the myriad factors that influence student performance and trends in education.

#### **Objective**
Our endeavor circles around the meticulous analysis of the ENEM 2022 dataset to forecast various outcomes using supervised learning techniques. The heart of our analysis can be bifurcated into two critical pathways:

- **Regression Analysis**: Targeted at predicting quantifiable outcomes such as student scores, utilizing regression techniques to find out the underlying patterns and correlations in student performances.
  
- **Classification Analysis**: Aiming to categorize students into different groups based on a set of predetermined criteria. It could be understanding their likelihood to pursue higher education or categorizing them based on their performance metrics.

By weaving through the extensive data trail of ENEM 2022, we aim to unearth insights that could potentially shape educational policies, assist educational institutions in crafting tailored strategies, and help students in making informed decisions.

#### **Collaboration**
We welcome data enthusiasts, educational researchers, and policy makers to collaborate and enrich this project with diverse perspectives and expertise. Together, we can strive to make a substantial impact in the educational sphere through data-driven insights and analysis.

#### **Contribution**
Feel free to fork the repository, open issues, and submit pull requests. Your contributions will be duly acknowledged, and we look forward to building a rich repository of analyses and insights centered around the ENEM 2022 dataset.
