### 1.**Predictive Analysis of ENEM 2022 Performance**

#### **Introduction**
The Exame Nacional do Ensino MÃ©dio (ENEM) holds a pivotal role in shaping Brazil's education landscape, serving as a determinant for student admissions into numerous higher education institutions in Brazil and even abroad. Leveraging the rich dataset that ENEM offers allows for a deep dive into the myriad factors that influence student performance and trends in education.

#### **Objective**
Our endeavor circles around the meticulous analysis of the ENEM 2022 dataset to forecast various outcomes using supervised learning techniques. The heart of our analysis can be bifurcated into two critical pathways:

- **Regression Analysis**: Targeted at predicting quantifiable outcomes such as student scores, utilizing regression techniques to find out the underlying patterns and correlations in student performances.
  
- **Classification Analysis**: Aiming to categorize students into different groups based on a set of predetermined criteria. It could be understanding their likelihood to pursue higher education or categorizing them based on their performance metrics.

By weaving through the extensive data trail of ENEM 2022, we aim to unearth insights that could potentially shape educational policies, assist educational institutions in crafting tailored strategies, and help students in making informed decisions.

#### **Collaboration**
We welcome data enthusiasts, educational researchers, and policy makers to collaborate and enrich this project with diverse perspectives and expertise. Together, we can strive to make a substantial impact in the educational sphere through data-driven insights and analysis.

#### **Contribution**
Feel free to fork the repository, open issues, and submit pull requests. Your contributions will be duly acknowledged, and we look forward to building a rich repository of analyses and insights centered around the ENEM 2022 dataset.

## Single-Cell Perturbations Analysis Project

### Introduction

Welcome to our project repository where we unravel the mysteries of single-cell perturbations in the dynamic field of biotechnology and data science. Leveraging a rich dataset from a Kaggle competition focused on open problems in single-cell perturbations, we aim to foster groundbreaking discoveries in cellular responses to small molecule drug perturbations.

### Background

Our project is centered around a novel dataset created using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). This dataset, derived from a meticulous experiment involving 144 compounds from the LINCS Connectivity Map dataset, offers a rich multi-omic background, providing a fertile ground for establishing biological priors that elucidate the susceptibility of specific genes to perturbation responses in various biological contexts.

### Objective

The primary goal of this endeavor is to develop predictive models capable of accurately forecasting cellular responses to small molecule drug perturbations. Our objectives are multi-faceted, encompassing:

1. **Data Exploration and Understanding**: Through comprehensive EDA, we aim to unearth underlying patterns and grasp the biological context of the data.
2. **Model Development**: Utilizing unsupervised learning techniques, primarily focusing on matrix factorization methods, we aspire to build predictive models and juxtapose them against supervised learning models to discern the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.
3. **Performance Evaluation**: This involves rigorous testing of the models to gauge their predictive accuracy and robustness.
4. **Improvement and Optimization**: We are committed to continually refining our models, overcoming limitations, and enhancing their predictive accuracy.

### Significance

This project stands as a beacon in the confluence of data science and biotechnology, striving to spearhead advancements in medicine through predictive analysis of cellular responses to drug perturbations. It promises not only a substantial learning curve for participants but also a potential pathway to revolutionary discoveries in the medical field.

### Structure

Our project is structured into two pivotal phases:

1. **Exploration and Understanding**: A deep dive into the dataset to understand the biological context and uncover underlying patterns through detailed EDA.
2. **Model Development and Evaluation**: This phase is dedicated to the development of predictive models using unsupervised learning techniques, followed by a rigorous evaluation to ascertain their performance and potential areas for improvement.

### Getting Started

To get started with the project, navigate through the repository to find detailed documentation on each phase of the project, including the methodologies employed, the results obtained, and the conclusions derived from the analysis.

We invite collaborators and enthusiasts to join us in this analytical journey to unlock the potential of unsupervised learning in the realm of single-cell perturbations analysis. Feel free to contribute, suggest improvements, and raise issues as we collectively work towards a deeper understanding of cellular responses to drug perturbations.
