### 1.**Predictive Analysis of ENEM 2022 Performance**

#### **Introduction**
The Exame Nacional do Ensino Médio (ENEM) holds a pivotal role in shaping Brazil's education landscape, serving as a determinant for student admissions into numerous higher education institutions in Brazil and even abroad. Leveraging the rich dataset that ENEM offers allows for a deep dive into the myriad factors that influence student performance and trends in education.

#### **Objective**
Our endeavor circles around the meticulous analysis of the ENEM 2022 dataset to forecast various outcomes using supervised learning techniques. The heart of our analysis can be bifurcated into two critical pathways:

- **Regression Analysis**: Targeted at predicting quantifiable outcomes such as student scores, utilizing regression techniques to find out the underlying patterns and correlations in student performances.
  
- **Classification Analysis**: Aiming to categorize students into different groups based on a set of predetermined criteria. It could be understanding their likelihood to pursue higher education or categorizing them based on their performance metrics.

By weaving through the extensive data trail of ENEM 2022, we aim to unearth insights that could potentially shape educational policies, assist educational institutions in crafting tailored strategies, and help students in making informed decisions.

#### **Collaboration**
We welcome data enthusiasts, educational researchers, and policy makers to collaborate and enrich this project with diverse perspectives and expertise. Together, we can strive to make a substantial impact in the educational sphere through data-driven insights and analysis.

#### **Contribution**
Feel free to fork the repository, open issues, and submit pull requests. Your contributions will be duly acknowledged, and we look forward to building a rich repository of analyses and insights centered around the ENEM 2022 dataset.

### 2. **BBC News Classification Project: Unsupervised and Supervised Learning Approaches**
#### **Kaggle Notebook Analysis - Unsupervised Algorithms in Machine Learning**

#### **Introduction**
In this project, we undertake a detailed analysis of the BBC News dataset leveraging both unsupervised and supervised learning techniques. The objective is to unravel hidden patterns and extract meaningful insights from the news articles, categorizing them accurately into predefined groups to facilitate efficient information retrieval and enhance reader experience.

#### **Structure of the Repository**
To foster a deeper understanding of the news classification process, we have structured the repository into the following sections:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: This section offers a deep dive into the dataset, showcasing detailed text analysis through tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and visualization of word statistics to provide a comprehensive overview of the data at hand.
- **Unsupervised Learning Models**: Here, we delve into the strategies adopted for unsupervised learning, exploring matrix factorization techniques and setting forth the evaluation metrics to gauge the performance of the built models.
- **Supervised Learning Model Comparison**: A segment dedicated to the comparative study of various supervised learning models, discussing their performance, data efficiency, and addressing potential overfitting issues.
- **Limitations of sklearn’s Non-negative Matrix Factorization Library**: In this part, we explore the limitations encountered while using the sklearn library, suggesting possible improvements and ways to overcome these challenges.

#### **Contribution and Collaboration**
We welcome contributions from data enthusiasts, researchers, and policy makers to enrich the project with diverse perspectives and expertise. Feel free to fork the repository, open issues, and submit pull requests. Your contributions will be duly acknowledged, and we look forward to building a rich repository of analyses and insights centered around the BBC News dataset.

#### **Objective**
The heart of our analysis can be bifurcated into two critical pathways:
- **Regression Analysis**: Aimed at predicting quantifiable outcomes such as scores in various metrics, utilizing regression techniques to find underlying patterns and correlations in the data.
- **Classification Analysis**: This pathway focuses on categorizing news articles into different groups based on a set of predetermined criteria, enhancing the reader's ability to find articles aligned with their interests.

#### **Future Prospects**
This project opens avenues for further research and development in the field of text classification, beckoning contributions that can aid in the crafting of educational strategies and fostering informed decision-making through data-driven insights derived from the analysis of news articles.

### 3. Single-Cell Perturbations Analysis Project

#### Introduction

Welcome to our project repository where we unravel the mysteries of single-cell perturbations in the dynamic field of biotechnology and data science. Leveraging a rich dataset from a Kaggle competition focused on open problems in single-cell perturbations, we aim to foster groundbreaking discoveries in cellular responses to small molecule drug perturbations.

#### Background

Our project is centered around a novel dataset created using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). This dataset, derived from a meticulous experiment involving 144 compounds from the LINCS Connectivity Map dataset, offers a rich multi-omic background, providing a fertile ground for establishing biological priors that elucidate the susceptibility of specific genes to perturbation responses in various biological contexts.

#### Objective

The primary goal of this endeavor is to develop predictive models capable of accurately forecasting cellular responses to small molecule drug perturbations. Our objectives are multi-faceted, encompassing:

1. **Data Exploration and Understanding**: Through comprehensive EDA, we aim to unearth underlying patterns and grasp the biological context of the data.
2. **Model Development**: Utilizing unsupervised learning techniques, primarily focusing on matrix factorization methods, we aspire to build predictive models and juxtapose them against supervised learning models to discern the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.
3. **Performance Evaluation**: This involves rigorous testing of the models to gauge their predictive accuracy and robustness.
4. **Improvement and Optimization**: We are committed to continually refining our models, overcoming limitations, and enhancing their predictive accuracy.

#### Significance

This project stands as a beacon in the confluence of data science and biotechnology, striving to spearhead advancements in medicine through predictive analysis of cellular responses to drug perturbations. It promises not only a substantial learning curve for participants but also a potential pathway to revolutionary discoveries in the medical field.

#### Structure

Our project is structured into two pivotal phases:

1. **Exploration and Understanding**: A deep dive into the dataset to understand the biological context and uncover underlying patterns through detailed EDA.
2. **Model Development and Evaluation**: This phase is dedicated to the development of predictive models using unsupervised learning techniques, followed by a rigorous evaluation to ascertain their performance and potential areas for improvement.
